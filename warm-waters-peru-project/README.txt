Data Sources:

animal-word-trends:
Derived from a subset of the Google Books Initiative. The subset tracks the publication frequencies for hundreds of animal words in printed materials over the past 300 years.

El Ni√±o years:
Based on the Nino 1+2 index. This measures average sea surface temperature anomalies relative to a base period of 30 years across a region. The Nino 1+2 region is off of Peru (0-10S, 90W to 80W).
